------------------
-- * Exercise 8.1
------------------
-- Types can be instance of multiple type classes, for example, Int is an instance of Integral and Num.

------------------
-- * Exercise 8.2
------------------
-- a) what does it mean for two functions to be equal, mathematically?  for f and g, we can say f == g if for all x, f(x) == g(x)
-- b) why is it hard to check if two functions are equal?  Cannot check all points
-- c) a repeating function such as sine

------------------
-- * Exercise 8.3
------------------
-- (*2) is the same as (2*), but (/2) not same as (2/), because order doesn't matter in multiplication, but it does in division

------------------
-- * Exercise 8.4
------------------
-- section to square argument: (**2)
-- section to cube argument: (**3)
